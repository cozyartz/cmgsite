## ðŸ“Š Lead Scoring System

### How It Works

The AI analyzes conversations in real-time and assigns scores based on:

#### **Interest Indicators** (10-20 points each)
- **Pricing inquiries**: "What do you charge?", "How much does it cost?"
- **Service requests**: "I need a website", "Can you help with SEO?"
- **Timeline questions**: "When can you start?", "How long does it take?"
- **Business mentions**: References to company, business needs

#### **Urgency Signals** (20-25 points each)
- **Immediate needs**: "ASAP", "urgent", "immediately"
- **Deadlines**: "launch date", "deadline", "by next month"
- **Competitive pressure**: "getting quotes", "comparing options"

#### **Engagement Depth** (5-15 points each)
- **Message length**: Detailed descriptions worth more points
- **Conversation duration**: Sustained engagement = higher scores
- **Follow-up questions**: Shows genuine interest

#### **Contact Sharing** (15-20 points each)
- **Email provided**: Automatic +20 points
- **Phone number**: +15 points
- **Company details**: +10 points

### Lead Qualification Thresholds

| Score Range | Status | Action |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| **0-29** | Visitor | Continue conversation |
| **30-49** | Warm Lead | Show lead capture form |
| **50-74** | Qualified Lead | Auto-create in CRM |
| **75-100** | Hot Lead | Priority notification + CRM |

### Example Scoring Scenarios
